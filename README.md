# Final Project Proposal 

## Contributing to organizer.network
organizer.network is a tool for social justice organizing. It was created and is maintained by Dan Phiffer. organizer.network is very much in the early stages of development as a tool and as an open source project. As a team we will contribute to the code as well as the GitHub documentation so that people who want to use organizer.network for their own organizing can easily do so without having too much technical experience.

## Define the problem. 
*What is the current state of things? What issue do you wish to solve and why? Who is the audience?*

organizer.network is a fully working and usable tool. The documentation for how to run the code and how to run your own instance is still in its early stages. We would like to help in making the documentation as low level as possible so that the audience, whether they are an experience organizer wishing to have more control of their data or a software engineer, can access the code and understand how best to use organizer.network for their own purposes.

## Deliverables
*Propose a clear list of deliverables.*

- organizer.network version 0.0.7 (or higher): create a stable set of upgrades to be released as the next version(s)
- User Guides: from how to install and implement your own instance to how to contribute
- Roadmap: features and developments for the future
- Distribute: Increasing the number of organizers & people using organizer.network

## Implementation
*Describe the technical details about your implementation and development process.*

Since Dan is the only contributor and coordinator at the moment we must sync up with him in order to enter the project smoothly. At the moment, it seems like most of our contribution will be by making the code and setup docs more approachable.

## Timeline
*This project will be completed over 5 weeks (Nov 6 - Dec 11). Describe a timeline in detail below.*

### Week 1
* Develop streamlined process for submitting issues, opening pull requests, checking in with Dan and merging code.

### Week 2
* Development of documentation for installing organizer.network according to our own experiences
* 

### Week 3
* Task list

### Week 4
* Task list

### Week 5
* Task list

## Documentation
*Describe your plan for documentation. Will you keep a blog? Make videos? Some project management tool? Track everything on GitHub as issues?*
- organizer.network docomentation: As Dan mentioned, documentation "is very important to the project". Every step of the way will be accompanied by a document with the corresponding feature, design choice or guide.
- Work process documentation: We are using organizer.network meta-channel to coordinate our work, ask and answer questions, and for general announcements. Therefore, naturally, we are creating a documentation of our process.

## Mentoring
*List some possible mentors for this project. Describe what kinds of help you need (technical, conceptual, outreach, etc.)*

## More about you
*emma rae norton*
I am very interested in open source as a model for making, collaborating, and organizing. My first contribution to an open source GitHub repository was quickly shut down for contributing something that didn't meet the repository owner's expectations, none of which were outlined to begin with. Fearing that this would happen again I have been wary of overstepping my bounds but have since found comfort in contributing to those projects that have clear guidelines and prioritize care over code.

*nicolás escarpentier*
I am a Chilean tech artist and activist and I have focused myself on creating tools for activism: either by augmenting diverse forms of expression or foregrounding gender and social issues. So far these projects have stayed in a more private place, even though most of them are stored public repositories, they're not easily or readily replicable. By starting to contribute and seeing how an open source project is formed, I intend to gain knowledge that will help me provide my own projects to a wider audience.

*Hadar Ben-Tzur*
Visual designer & illustrator from Jerusalem. Working on an open source project, which shape itself based on people needs and contributions sounds like an ideal work environment for me. I have a diverse background in art and design, data analysis and education – I'd love to use the skills I have to contribute to this project.
