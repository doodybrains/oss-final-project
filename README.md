# Final Project Proposal 

## Contributing to organizer.network
organizer.network is a tool for social justice organizing. It was created and is maintained by Dan Phiffer. organizer.network is very much in the early stages of development as a tool and as an open source project. As a team we will contribute to the code as well as the GitHub documentation so that people who want to use organizer.network for their own organizing can easily do so without having too much technical experience.

## Define the problem. 
*What is the current state of things? What issue do you wish to solve and why? Who is the audience?*
organizer.network is a fully working and usable tool. The documentation for how to run the code and how to run your own instance is still in its early stages. We would like to help in making the documentation as low level as possible so that the audience, whether they are an experience organizer wishing to have more control of their data or a software engineer, can access the code and understand how best to use organizer.network for their own purposes.

## More about you
*emma rae norton*
I am very interested in open source as a model for making, collaborating, and organizing. My first contribution to an open source GitHub repository was quickly shut down for contributing something that didn't meet the repository owner's expectations, none of which were outlined to begin with. Fearing that this would happen again I have been wary of overstepping my bounds but have since found comfort in contributing to those projects that have clear guidelines and prioritize care over code.
