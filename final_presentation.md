## Deliverables / Work Product

_What did you deliver? Link to all relevant project pages (GitHub repo, pull request, documentation site, etc.)._

## Define the problem you addressed and greater landscape

organizer.network was built by Dan Pfiffer who was also our mentor throughout this project. The tool itself fills an immediate need for social justice organizers who want to organize and interact on a platform that is free and also does not exploit their use of it. The structure of the project is similar to projects like Mastodon in that there can be many different instances of organizer.network and each instance only cares about its own users.

Currently organizer.network is a fully working tool that anyone with an email address can use. The issue we set out to solve was how to make the documentation for setting up a personal instance better so that people interested could create their own organizer.netorks.

## Implementation
1. _What themes, readings, and discussion from [the first half of this course](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Syllabus) were most relevant to your work on this project? Version Control, Community / Code of Conduct, Unit Testing, Documentation and Accessibility, Software Licensing, Project Funding_

- Terminology & Ideology: One of the first discussions we had with Dan was regarding our target audience (people not users), and the social impact Dan is aiming for as the creator of organizer.network. The project might not have a Code of Conduct yet, but it definitely has a very clear tone.
- Documentation and Accessibility: Together with Dan we identified a need of creating a clear documentation for setting up a personal instance.

2. _Describe the technical details about your implementation and development process._

- We each tried to follow Dan's initial documentation for setting up a personal instance and documented our progress in an organizer.network group we opened for that purpose.
- We compared our notes â€“ and wrote a new guide.
- Hadar (who failed setting up a personal instance the first time) tried again with the new guide.
- We compared the first attempt to the second, together with Dan's feedback on our organizer.network group.
- Emma & Nico conducted a test in class to see if we reached the desired outcome.
- + Every Sunday at 2 pm we joined Dan on a video call to discuss the future (and present) of organizer.network.



3. _What challenges, stumbling blocks, difficulties did you encounter along the way._

- Early stage project: Since Dan was the only contributor when we entered the process - There was no organized process of contribution and review. It took us a moment to understand where can we step in, and what will be the most effective working method in order to support Dan's work.

4. _How did your final development line up with your proposal timeline._

We managed to write the documentation for setting up a personal instance and test it twice (one by ourselves, and one in class). We haven't dived into the code, which maybe can happen at a later stage when the basic functions are in place.

5. _What was your biggest success? What was your biggest failure?_

Success? writing the documentation while giving and receiving good and healthy feedback together with Dan.
Failure? Not sure there is one.

## Accessibility

_What challenges did you encounter in terms of Web Content Accessibility Requirements: [see the Accessibility assignment as a reference](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Syllabus/blob/source/accessibility-assignment.md#instructions)._

## Mentoring

_Who did you receive help and mentorship from? What was most useful to you during this process?_

## Longer-Term Goals

_What do you see as the longer term plan for this project and your project involvement?_
